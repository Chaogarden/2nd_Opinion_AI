  "overall_summary": "Your doctor's clinical note received a borderline rating with an overall score of 77% (see: overall_score). While they captured most medication information (100%), there were notable omissions in symptom coverage at 33% (symptom_coverage)",
  "overall_rating": "fair",
  "strengths": "The doctor's treatment plan aligned with clinical guidelines 80% of the time (guideline_adherence_score), and their safety score was high at 90% (safety_score). They also captured all medication information (medication_coverage:100%)",
  "concerns": "Notable omissions in symptom coverage, including 'mon-', 'slight_cramps', 'palpitations', 'chest_pain_(slight_cramps)', and 'cough' (notable_omissions). Additionally, the doctor missed a red-flag diagnosis of Anxiety or Depression (missed_diagnoses:1) and a potential drug interaction between Lasix and Lisinopril (safety_concerns)",
  "documentation_quality": "The note captured 33% of key symptoms but lacked comprehensive coverage (symptom_coverage). The medication list was complete, however (medication_coverage:100%)",
  "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis coherence score was lower than expected at 60% (diagnosis_coherence_score), and a red-flag diagnosis of Anxiety or Depression was missed (missed_diagnoses:1)",
  "treatment_plan": "The doctor's treatment plan aligned with clinical guidelines 80% of the time (guideline_adherence_score). However, specific guideline IDs were not provided",

  "recommendations": "Consider running the 2nd Opinion AI diagnostic analysis on your case for a comprehensive second opinion that cross-references your symptoms with clinical guidelines. This will help ensure all relevant information is considered in your care.",
  "full_narrative": "Your doctor's clinical note was thorough in some areas, but there were notable omissions and missed diagnoses. Specifically, they captured most medication information (100%) but only 33% of key symptoms (symptom_coverage). A red-flag diagnosis of Anxiety or Depression was also missed (missed_diagnoses:1), which is concerning given the patient's reported fatigue, lightheadedness, and palpitations (dialogue evidence available). Additionally, a potential drug interaction between Lasix and Lisinopril was identified as a safety concern (safety_concerns). To ensure comprehensive care, we recommend running the 2nd Opinion AI diagnostic analysis on your case. This will provide a thorough review of your symptoms and medical history against clinical guidelines."
