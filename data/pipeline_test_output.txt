Text:
These include anxiety and depression, obesity (p.117), deconditioning, chronic
rhinosinusitis (p.120), inducible laryngeal obstruction, GERD (p.118), COPD (p.133), obstructive sleep apnea,
bronchiectasis, cardiac disease, and kyphosis due to osteoporosis. Investigate according to clinical suspicion. • Modifiable risk factors and triggers: Identify factors that increase the risk of exacerbations, e.g., smoking, vaping,
environmental tobacco exposure, other environmental exposures at home or work including allergens (if sensitized),
indoor and outdoor air pollution, molds and noxious chemicals, and medications such as beta-blockers or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). For allergens, check for sensitization using skin prick testing or specific
immunoglobin (Ig) E.
• Regular use and over-use of SABAs: Regular SABA use causes beta-receptor down-regulation and reduction in
response,692 leading in turn to greater use. SABA over-use may also be habitual. Dispensing of ≥3 SABA canisters
per year (corresponding to average use more than daily) is associated with increased risk of emergency department
visit or hospitalization independent of severity,92,93 and dispensing of ≥12 canisters per year (one a month) is
associated with substantially increased risk of death.93,95 Risks are higher with nebulized SABA.693
• Anxiety, depression and social and economic problems: These are very common in asthma, particularly in difficult
asthma687 and contribute to symptoms, impaired quality of life, and poor adherence. • Medication side-effects: Systemic effects, particularly with frequent or continuous OCS, or long-term high-dose ICS
may contribute to poor quality of life and increase the likelihood of poor adherence. Local side-effects of dysphonia
or candidiasis may occur with high-dose or potent ICS, especially if inhaler technique is poor. Consider drug
interactions including risk of adrenal suppression with use of P450 inhibitors such as itraconazole. 3. Review and optimi...

• Consider systemic corticosteroids for children attending an emergency department or admitted to hospital: oral
prednisone/prednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/day up to a maximum of 20 mg/day for children aged 0–2 years; 30 mg/day for
children aged 3–5 years, for up to 5 days, or dexamethasone 0.3 to 0.6 mg/kg/day for 1–2 days. If symptoms do not
resolve, or recur, during dexamethasone treatment, consider switching to prednisolone. • Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry may be overestimated in people with dark skin color. Arrange early follow-up after an exacerbation
• Instruct parent/caregiver to seek medical care if there is no improvement or a deterioration over the next 24–48
hours. • If feasible, arrange follow-up within 1–3 days of an exacerbation and again 1–2 months later to plan ongoing asthma
management. Children who have experienced an asthma exacerbation are at risk of further exacerbations, so they should be
assessed for management to reduce this risk. 12. Management of exacerbations (children 5 years and younger)
DIAGNOSIS OF EXACERBATIONS
A flare-up (exacerbation) of asthma in children 5 years and younger is defined as an acute or sub-acute deterioration in
symptom control that is sufficient to cause distress or risk to health. An exacerbations may necessitate a visit to a
healthcare provider or require treatment with systemic corticosteroids. In pediatric resources, the term “episode” is
commonly used. Early symptoms of an exacerbation may include any of the following:
• Onset of symptoms of respiratory tract infection
• An acute or sub-acute increase in wheeze and shortness of breath
• An increase in coughing, especially while the child is asleep
• Lethargy or reduced exercise tolerance
• Impairment of daily activities, including feeding
• A poor response to reliever medication. In a study of children aged 2–5 years, the combination of increased daytime cough, daytime wheeze, and night-time beta2agonist use was a strong predictor at a group level of an imminent ...

The most common side effects of SSRIs are headaches, irritability, nausea and other gastrointestinal issues, insomnia, sexual
dysfunction, weight gain, increased anxiety, drowsiness,
and tremor. Some of these effects (e.g., nausea) are usually
transient, lasting 1–2 weeks. Others (e.g., sexual dysfunction) commonly last for the duration of treatment. Side effects of SSRIs are highly individualized. For example, a
particular SSRI may cause insomnia in one patient but
somnolence in another. Thus, although comparative studies may tend to favor one medication over another for a
particular side effect, a given patient may still experience
that particular side effect. Fortunately, there are several
SSRIs on the market, and it is usually possible to ﬁnd one
that the patient can tolerate well; this may require a process
of engaging in several therapeutic trials until the optimal
medication is found for a given patient. There are scattered reports in the literature of extrapyramidal side effects, but these have not been observed in large
multicenter trials and may be idiosyncratic. Some evidence
suggests that SSRIs may be associated with an increased
likelihood of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly
when taken in combination with NSAIDs or with aspirin
(260, 261). Use of SSRIs also has been found to be associated with low bone mineral density in male patients age 65
years and older (262), increased rate of bone loss at the hip
in older female patients (263), and increased risk of falls and
of osteoporotic fractures in patients age 50 years and older
(264, 265). In addition, as described earlier in Section II.H,
the FDA has warned of the possibility that SSRIs and other
antidepressants may increase the risk of suicidal ideation
and behavior in patients age 25 years and younger (227). Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association. APA makes this practice guideline freely available to promote its dissemination and use; however, copyright

The main symptom is severe fatigue (usually for > 6 mo) that interferes with daily activities (see Table 348-1 for usual symptoms and signs). Usually, no signs of muscle weakness, arthritis, neuropathy, or organomegaly are present. However, some definitions require the presence of low-grade fever, nonexudative pharyngitis, or palpable or tender lymph nodes. Diagnosis • Clinical criteria [Table 348-1. Diagnostic Criteria for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome] Because there is no definitive diagnostic test, diagnosis is by clinical criteria (see Table 348-1). However, because multiple definitions exist, the criteria are not agreed on universally and should not always be strictly applied to individual patients. The criteria are more useful for epidemiologic and clinical studies than for excluding the diagnosis in individual patients. Further evaluation aims to exclude treatable disorders. A reasonable assessment includes CBC and measurement of electrolytes, ESR, and thyroidstimulating hormone. In some cases, chest x-ray and tests for antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, hepatitis, and HIV should be added. Other viral antibody and other expensive tests are unlikely to shed light on the diagnosis or cause. Obvious depression or severe anxiety excludes the diagnosis of CFS. Treatment • Sometimes nonsedating antidepressants • Sometimes psychologic intervention, physical rehabilitation, and/or regular exercise • Avoidance of prolonged rest Nonsedating antidepressants are commonly prescribed, although their value is undetermined. Antiviral treatments with acyclovir and amantadine do not seem effective. V&lganciclovir is under study. Studies of immunologic treatments, including high-dose immune globulins, dialyzable WBC extract, amphigen, interferons, isoprinosine, and corticosteroids, have been inconclusive and mostly disappointing. Dietary supplements and high-dose vitamins are commonly used, but their usefulness has not been substantiated. Psychologic intervention (eg, individu...

Symptoms consist of insomnia, irritability, depression, nausea, and anorexia; symptoms peak at 2 to 3 days and last up to 7 days. Diagnosis • Clinical evaluation Diagnosis is usually made clinically. Drug levels are not measured. Most routine urine drug screens include marijuana (see p. 1510). Treatment • Supportive measures Treatment is usually unnecessary; for patients experiencing significant discomfort, treatment is supportive. Management of abuse typically consists of behavioral therapy in an outpatient drug treatment program. Cocaine Cocaine is a sympathomimetic drug with CNS stimulant and euphoriant properties. High doses can cause panic, schizophrenic-like symptoms, seizures, hyperthermia, hypertension, arrhythmias, stroke, aortic dissection, intestinal ischemia, and Ml. Toxicity is managed with supportive care, including IV benzodiazepines (for agitation, hypertension, and seizures) and cooling techniques (for hyperthermia). Withdrawal manifests primarily as depression, difficulty concentrating, and somnolence (cocaine washout syndrome). 1694 The Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 160. Drug Use & Dependence Most cocaine users are episodic recreational users. However, about 25% (or more) of users meet criteria for abuse or dependence. Use among adolescents has declined recently. Availability of highly biologically active forms, such as crack cocaine, has worsened the problem of cocaine dependence. Most cocaine in the US is about 50 to 60% pure; it may contain a wide array of fillers, adulterants, and contaminants. Most cocaine in the US is volatilized and inhaled, but it may be snorted, or injected IV. For inhalation, the powdered hydrochloride salt is converted to a more volatile form, usually by adding NaHCC>3, water, and heat. The resultant precipitate (crack cocaine) is volatilized by heating (it is not burned) and inhaled. Onset of effect is quick, and intensity of the high rivals IV injection. Tolerance to cocaine occurs, and wit...

Later in the several weeks' course of the disease, jaundice, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, myocarditis, and heart failure may occur, especially in louse-borne disease. Other symptoms may include ophthalmitis, iridocyclitis, exacerbation of asthma, and erythema multiforme. Meningismus is rare. Spontaneous abortion can occur. 1411 The Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 136. Spirochetes The patient is usually asymptomatic for several days to > 1 wk between the initial episode and the first relapse. Relapses, related to the cyclic development of the parasites, occur with a sudden return of fever and often arthralgia and all the former symptoms and signs. Jaundice is more common during relapse. The illness clears as before, but 2 to 10 similar episodes may follow at intervals of 1 to 2 wk. The episodes become progressively less severe, and patients eventually recover as they develop immunity. Diagnosis • Darkfield microscopy The diagnosis is suggested by recurrent fever and confirmed by visualization of spirochetes in the blood during a febrile episode. The spirochetes may be seen on darkfield examination or Wright's- or Giemsastained thick and thin blood smears. (Acridine orange stain for examining blood or tissue is more sensitive than Wright's or Giemsa stain.) Serologic tests are unreliable. Mild polymorphonuclear leukocytosis may occur. Serologic tests for syphilis and Lyme disease may be falsely positive. Differential diagnosis includes Lyme arthritis, malaria, dengue, yellow fever, leptospirosis, typhus, influenza, and enteric fevers. Treatment • Tetracycline, doxycycline, or erythromycin In relapsing fever transmitted by ticks, tetracycline or erythromycin 500 mg po q 6 h is given for 5 to 10 days. A single 500-mg oral dose of either drug cures louse-transmitted fever. Doxycycline 100 mg po q 12 h for 5 to 10 days is also effective. Children < 8 yr are given erythromycin estolate 10 mg/kg po tid. When vomiting or severe disease precludes oral...

Several high-quality and mediumquality studies support the role of pregabalin in treatment of pain in DPN. One
high-quality study and many small studies
support the role of gabapentin in the
treatment of pain in DPN. Medium-quality
studies suggest that mirogabalin has a
small effect on pain in DPN (80). Adverse effects may be more severe in
older individuals (83) and may be attenuated by lower starting doses and
more gradual titration. SNRIs. SNRIs include duloxetine, venlafaxine, and desvenlafaxine, all selective
SNRIs. Two high-quality studies and ﬁve
medium-quality studies support the role
of duloxetine in the treatment of pain in
DPN. A high-quality study supports the
role of venlafaxine in the treatment of
pain in DPN. Onlyone medium-quality study
supports a possible role for desvenlafaxine
for treatment of pain in DPN (80). Adverse
events may be more severe in older people
but may be attenuated with lower doses
and slower titration of duloxetine. Tricyclic Antidepressants. TCAs have been
studied for treatment of pain. Most of
the relevant data were acquired from trials of amitriptyline and include two highquality studies and two medium-quality
Retinopathy, Neuropathy, and Foot Care
S257 studies supporting the effectiveness of
amitryiptylinein in the treatment of painful DPN (80,82). Anticholinergic side effects may be dose limiting and restrict
use in individuals $65 years of age. Sodium Channel Blockers. Sodium channel blockers include lamotrigine, lacosamide, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and
valproic acid. Five medium-quality studies
support the role of sodium channel blockers in treating pain in DPN (80). Capsaicin. Capsaicin has received FDA approval for treatment of pain in DPN using
an 8% patch, with one high-quality study
reported. One medium-quality study of
0.075% capsaicin cream has been reported. In individuals with contraindications to oral pharmacotherapy or who
prefer topical treatments, the use of topical capsaicin can be considered. Lidocaine

Text:
Given that opioids and
SNRIs are both effective for painful DPN, it
is not surprising that these SNRI and opioid
agents are effective in the treatment of
pain in DPN too (80). However, the effect
size is similar to that of other effective
therapies, such as SNRIs, and these medications have the same risks as other
opioids listed above. In fact, tramadol
has been shown to be associated with
all-cause mortality with an effect size similar to that of codeine (87). Similar to other
opioids, risks likely outweigh beneﬁts, and
the AAN guidelines also recommend
against their use for painful DPN (80). Orthostatic Hypotension
Treating orthostatic hypotension is challenging. The therapeutic goal is to minimize postural symptoms rather than to
restore normotension. Most individuals
require both nonpharmacologic measures
(e.g., ensuring adequate salt intake, avoiding medications that aggravate hypotension, or using compressive garments over
the legs and abdomen) and pharmacologic
measures. Physical activity and exercise
should be encouraged to avoid deconditioning, which is known to exacerbate
orthostatic intolerance, and volume repletion with ﬂuids and salt is critical. Additionally, supine blood pressure tends
to be much higher in these individuals,
often requiring treatment of blood pressure at bedtime with shorter-acting drugs
that also affect baroreceptor activity
such as guanfacine or clonidine, shorteracting calcium blockers (e.g., isradipine),
or shorter-acting b-blockers such as atenolol or metoprolol tartrate. Alternatives
can include enalapril if an individual
is unable to tolerate preferred agents
(88–90). Midodrine and droxidopa are approved by the FDA for the treatment of
orthostatic hypotension. Gastroparesis
Treatment of diabetic gastroparesis may
be very challenging. A small-particle diet
may
provide
some
symptom
relief
(91–93). In addition, foods with small
particle size may improve key symptoms
(94). Withdrawing drugs with adverse effects on gastrointestinal ...

The regular use of pillows under the knees while reclining encourages contractures and should also be avoided. Patients should sit in straight-back chairs without slumping, sleep on a firm bed, perhaps with a bed board, use a car seat shifted forward and designed for comfort, do postural exercises, wear wellsupported shoes or athletic shoes, and continue employment and physical activity. In OAof the spine, knee, or thumb carpometacarpal joint, various supports can relieve pain and increase function, but to preserve flexibility, they should be accompanied by specific exercise programs. In erosive OA, range-of-motion exercises done in warm water can help prevent contractures. Drugs: Drug therapy is an adjunct to the physical program. Acetaminophen in doses of up to 1 g po qid may relieve pain and is safe. More potent analgesia may be required. NSAIDs, including cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors or coxibs, may be considered if patients have refractory pain or signs of inflammation (eg, redness, warmth). NSAIDs may be used simultaneously with other analgesics (eg, tramadol, opioids) to provide better relief of symptoms. Muscle relaxants (usually in low doses) occasionally relieve pain that arises from muscles strained by attempting to support OAjoints. In the elderly, however, they may cause more adverse effects than relief. Oral corticosteroids have no role. However, intra-articular depot corticosteroids help relieve pain and increase joint flexibility. Synthetic hyaluronans (similar to hyaluronic acid, a normal component of the joint) can be injected into 432 The Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 35. Joint Disorders the knee, with pain relief for prolonged periods of time (up to a year). However, the effect seems to be small. The treatment is a series of 3 to 5 weekly injections. Glucosamine sulfate 1500 mg po once/day has been suggested to relieve pain and slow joint deterioration; chondroitin sulfate 1200 mg once/day has also been suggested...

Symptoms and Signs A chronic nagging ache, pain, tingling, or numbness starts in the buttocks and can extend along the course of the sciatic nerve, down the entire back of the thigh and calf, and sometimes into the foot. Pain worsens when the piriformis is pressed against the sciatic nerve (eg, while sitting on a toilet, a car seat, or a narrow bicycle seat or while running). Diagnosis • Physical examination and provocative testing Diagnosis is by physical examination. Pain with forceful internal rotation of the flexed thigh (Freiberg's maneuver), abduction of the affected leg while sitting (Pace's maneuver), raising of the knee several centimeters off the table while lying on a table on the side of the unaffected leg (Beatty's maneuver), or pressure into the buttocks where the sciatic nerve crosses the piriformis muscle while the patient slowly bends to the floor (Mirkin test) is diagnostic. Imaging is not useful except to rule out other causes of sciatic compression. Unlike piriformis pain, lumbar disk compression of the sciatic nerve (sciatica — see p. 383) usually causes low back pain in addition to sciatic pain down the lower extremity. However, differentiation from a lumbar disk disorder is sometimes difficult, and referral to a specialist may be needed. Treatment • Modification of activity • Stretches Patients should temporarily stop running, bicycling, or doing any activity that elicits pain. Patients whose pain is aggravated by sitting should stand or, if unable to do so, change positions to remove the source of pressure around the buttock. Specific stretching exercises for the posterior hip and piriformis can be beneficial. Surgery is rarely warranted. A carefully directed corticosteroid injection near the site where the piriformis muscle crosses the sciatic nerve often helps temporarily. NSAIDs can also provide temporary pain relief. Knee Pain Etiology There are many causes of pain in or around the knee in athletes, particularly runners, including • Sublu...

Prognosis Complete remissions occur in 50 to 75% of treated patients. Patients with polyarticular onset and a positive RF have a less favorable prognosis. Treatment • Drugs that slow disease progression • Usually NSAIDs Similar to the therapy of patients with adult RA, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), particularly the biologic agents, have dramatically changed the therapeutic approach. Symptoms may be reduced with NSAIDs. Naproxen 5 to 10 mg/kg po bid, ibuprofen 5 to 10 mg/kg po qid, 423 The Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 35. Joint Disorders and indomethacin 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg po tid are among the most useful. Salicylates are rarely used because of their possible role in causing Reye's syndrome (see p. 2937). Except for severe systemic disease, systemic corticosteroids can usually be avoided. When necessary, the lowest possible dose is used (eg, oral prednisone, 0.0125 to 0.5 mg/kg qid, or the same daily dose given once or twice daily). Growth retardation, osteoporosis, and osteonecrosis are the major hazards of prolonged corticosteroid use in children. Intra-articular depot corticosteroids can be given. The dosage for children is adjusted based on weight. Children may need to be sedated for intra-articular injection. Methotrexate is useful for pauciarticular and polyarticular disease. Adverse effects are monitored as in adults. Bone marrow depression and hepatic toxicity are monitored with CBC, AST, ALT, and albumin. Occasionally, sulfasalazine is used, especially in cases of suspected spondyloarthropathy. IM gold and penicillamine are rarely used. Etanercept, used as in adults, blocks tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and is often effective; 0.4 mg/kg sc (up to a maximum of 25 mg) is given twice/wk. Anakinra is particularly effective in some patients with systemic-onset disease. Physical therapy, exercises, splints, and other supportive measures help prevent flexion contractures. Adaptive devices can improve function and minim...
